## My Technical Blog

I don't blog frequently, but when I find something particularly interesting I sometimes write it up and post it here.

This blog uses GitHub Pages, which is a static website generator integrated nicely into github.  Some details:
* Jekyll generated site: <http://dwayneneed.github.io>
* Forked from https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io
