## My Technical Blog

I don't blog frequently, but when I find something particularly interesting I sometimes write it up and post it here.

This blog uses GitHub Pages, which is a static website generator integrated nicely into github.  Some details:
* Forked from [https://agusmakmun.github.io](https://agusmakmun.github.io)
* Online markdown editor <http://prose.io/#DwayneNeed/dwayneneed.github.io>
