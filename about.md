I am a developer and lead at Microsoft.  I joined the company in 1997 and have worked on a variety of projects including programming tools, OS development, UI frameworks, and cloud services.  I am currently working on Azure Stack.

I am particularly interested in .Net programming in C#, and the developer ecosystem around that.  I worked on WPF for a long time and was very proud of that framework.
